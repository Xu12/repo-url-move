# repo-url-move

I have changed my github username from JeffsanC to wang-chen, therefore your local repo url needs to be updated.

Just run this script to do this automatically.

Note that this script is only for updating your remote url, all your local modifications will be kept.

This script only needs to be run once. then you can delete this script safely!

Usages:

    git clone https://github.com/wang-chen/repo-url-move
    cd repo-url-move
    ./move.sh
Done!!
